# Face Mask Pattern

This describes how to sew a rectangular face mask, with 3 pleats across the
length. The mask can be attached on the ears or around the head.

## Materials
- fabric (at least a rectangle of 19.5cm by 21.5cm)
- 1m of thin elastic cord or narrow elastic band (â‰¤0.5cm wide)

## Instructions

### Prepare the fabric

- Cut a 19.5cm by 21.5cm rectangle in your fabric, taking care to align the
rectangle with the fabric's grain line.

- Line up the rectangle, with its shortest side being horizontal, and its
longest side being vertical.

- *Starting from the top*, cut notches on each side, spaced by these distances
(in cm, first measurement taken from the top edge of the rectangle, each
subsequent from the previous notch):

0.5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1

- *Starting from the bottom*, cut two more notches on each side, at 0.5cm from
the bottom edge of the rectangle and 1cm from the previous notch (or 0.5 and
1.5cm from the bottom edge)

### Form the top edge, bottom edge and pleats

Using the notches cut previously as guides, fold and iron in place the top
and bottom edge of the mask, as well as the pleats.

Pin the folded edges and pleats and baste-stitch along each remaining raw
edge, 0.5cm from the edge.

### Stitch the top and bottom edges

From the right side of the mask, stitch the bototm edge in place, taking care
to catch the folded fabric on the wrong side as well.

If you wish to use a doo-dah to pinch the mask at the nose, center it and
mark each end with chalk; with the doo-dah removed do a short stitch
perpendicular from the top edge at each end. Then reinsert the doo-dah
and stitch the top edge of the mask as you did for the bottom edge.

### Fold and stitch the sides of the mask

With one side of the mask: Fold in 0.5cm, then 1cm, over the elastic cord
or band. Stitch from the top, taking care to catch the fabric folded on
the wrong side of the mask, but not the elastic. Repeat on the other side.
